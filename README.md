# CodeU Final Project

The search engine will ask for a couple of descriptors and then show a gif that applies to the given description. It will help people find gifs faster because we have already gathered all of the gifs and they do not need to sort through images and gifs. It will be easier for users to find fitting gifs based on included descriptions.
